OH. My GODDDDD...
I didn't think this project would see the light of DAY!

Sorry this took so long, everybody!
It's just that as much fun as this project was, it actually went through... SO MANY ROUGH DRAFTS. Like, A BILLION ROUGH DRAFTS. The first beta I did of this used Sanspirate's textures too, so I had to improvise with a few certain textures and sounds that made me feel satisfied.

I've tested everything in this thing to make sure it all goes smoothly more times than I care to count too, so, yeah, as you can tell, I kinda went a little overboard with this one.

That said,
YOU ALL WANTED ANOTHER ONE? HERE YA GO, LADIES AND GENTS!
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT VIDEOS Y'ALL WILL MAKE WITH THIS ONE!

Ahem. Hopefully this tickles your fancy, so, have a good day, lovelies, melonheads, and lemonheads alike!

Voice Acting:

This game was inspired by "Baldi's Basics: The Old Laboratory of Failure Experiments", by Sanspirate, and he's made up to three chapters for it! Check his first game out here on GameBanana!
